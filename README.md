# Simple Iris Flower Prediction App

This is a simple web application that predicts the type of Iris flower based on user input parameters such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

##Libraries used

The following Python libraries were used to develop this app:

streamlit
pandas
scikit-learn

## User Input Parameters

The user can set the input parameters using the sliders provided in the sidebar. The following are the input parameters:

Sepal length
Sepal width
Petal length
Petal width
Prediction
The prediction is made using the random forest classifier algorithm from scikit-learn. The app predicts the type of Iris flower based on the input parameters provided by the user.

## Class labels and their corresponding index number
The app also displays the class labels and their corresponding index number. The three class labels are as follows:

Iris Setosa
Iris Versicolour
Iris Virginica

## Prediction Probability

The app displays the probability of each class label based on the input parameters provided by the user.
